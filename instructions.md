- Set up the `.gitignore` file for version control.

### Files to Initialize:
- `WhisperKitDemo.xcodeproj/`
- `.gitignore`
- `Package.swift`

---

## Phase 2: Core Audio Pipeline Implementation
- Develop audio streaming and processing capabilities in the `Core/AudioPipeline/` directory.
- Implement `AudioStreamManager.swift` for real-time audio input streaming.
- Add `AudioBufferManager.swift` to manage audio buffers.
- Create `NoiseReductionProcessor.swift` for noise filtering.

### Files to Develop:
- `Core/AudioPipeline/AudioStreamManager.swift`
- `Core/AudioPipeline/AudioBufferManager.swift`
- `Core/AudioPipeline/NoiseReductionProcessor.swift`

---

## Phase 3: Model Infrastructure Setup
- Integrate WhisperKit for transcription functionality.
- Implement `ModelLifecycleManager.swift` for model initialization and updates.
- Create `ModelPerformanceOptimizer.swift` to optimize transcription performance.

### Files to Develop:
- `Core/ModelInfrastructure/ModelLifecycleManager.swift`
- `Core/ModelInfrastructure/ModelPerformanceOptimizer.swift`

---

## Phase 4: Storage and iCloud Sync
- Develop local and cloud-based data storage mechanisms.
- Implement `StorageManager.swift` for unified file operations.
- Add `iCloudSyncManager.swift` for syncing data with iCloud.

### Files to Develop:
- `Core/Storage/StorageManager.swift`
- `Core/Storage/iCloudSyncManager.swift`

---

## Phase 5: Error Handling
- Implement error recovery and crash reporting mechanisms.
- Develop `ErrorRecoveryManager.swift` to handle non-critical errors.
- Create `CrashReporter.swift` for logging application crashes.

### Files to Develop:
- `Core/ErrorHandling/ErrorRecoveryManager.swift`
- `Core/ErrorHandling/CrashReporter.swift`

---

## Phase 6: Accessibility Enhancements
- Add support for VoiceOver and UI accessibility features.
- Implement `AccessibilityManager.swift` to manage accessibility settings.

### Files to Develop:
- `Core/Accessibility/AccessibilityManager.swift`

---

## Phase 7: SwiftUI Views
- Create user interface components for real-time transcription, settings, and history.
- Implement `ContentView.swift` as the main interface.
- Develop `SettingsView.swift` for configurable user settings.
- Add `HistoryView.swift` to display transcription history.

### Files to Develop:
- `Views/ContentView.swift`
- `Views/SettingsView.swift`
- `Views/HistoryView.swift`

---

## Phase 8: Service Managers
- Develop centralized service managers for logging, error management, and transcription.
- Implement `LoggingManager.swift` for debug logging.
- Create `TranscriptionManager.swift` to manage transcription tasks.

### Files to Develop:
- `Managers/LoggingManager.swift`
- `Managers/TranscriptionManager.swift`

---

## Phase 9: Advanced Audio Processing
- Add audio effects and format conversion capabilities.
- Develop `AudioEffectsProcessor.swift` for applying audio enhancements.
- Create `AudioFormatConverter.swift` for format compatibility.

### Files to Develop:
- `Core/AudioPipeline/AudioEffectsProcessor.swift`
- `Core/AudioPipeline/AudioFormatConverter.swift`

---

## Phase 10: Final Integration and Testing
- Integrate all components into a functional application.
- Conduct performance optimizations and usability testing.
- Prepare for App Store submission.

### Files to Review and Refactor:
- `WhisperKitDemoApp.swift`
- All other previously implemented files.

---

By following these phases, the project can be developed efficiently and systematically, ensuring quality and maintainability.
