## Functional Requirements
1. **Real-Time Speech Transcription**:
   - Utilize WhisperKit to transcribe audio input in real time.
   - Support multiple languages with seamless switching.
2. **Advanced Audio Processing**:
   - Implement noise reduction, format conversion, and audio effects.
   - Optimize processing pipeline for performance on iOS devices.
3. **Customizable Transcription Settings**:
   - Provide user-configurable options like language preferences, noise filtering, and data retention duration.
4. **Background Processing**:
   - Allow transcription to continue during background app usage.
5. **Accessibility**:
   - Include features like VoiceOver support and adjustable font sizes.
6. **iCloud Sync**:
   - Synchronize transcription history and settings across devices.
7. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error management for crashes and state recovery.
8. **Export & History Management**:
   - Enable export of transcription data in common formats.
   - Maintain a local history of transcription sessions.

## Key Modules and Components
### 1. Core
   - **AudioPipeline**:
     - Handles real-time audio data capture, processing, and streaming.
     - Components: `AudioProcessingManager`, `NoiseReductionProcessor`, `AudioStreamManager`.
   - **ModelInfrastructure**:
     - Manages lifecycle and performance of WhisperKit models.
     - Background task management and state optimization.
   - **Storage**:
     - File-based storage with iCloud synchronization.
     - Caching mechanisms for offline usage.
   - **ErrorHandling**:
     - Recovery systems for app crashes and persistent errors.
   - **Accessibility**:
     - AccessibilityManager for enhancing UX with ARIA labels and voice navigation.

### 2. Models
   - Represents transcription settings, audio metadata, and errors.

### 3. Views
   - SwiftUI-based views with modular, reusable components.
   - UI components for settings, history, and real-time transcription.

### 4. Managers
   - Centralized service components for logging, model management, and file handling.

## Data Flow and State Management
- **Real-Time Data Flow**:
   1. Audio input captured through `AudioStreamManager`.
   2. Noise-reduced and preprocessed via `AudioEffectsProcessor`.
   3. Sent to WhisperKit for transcription.
   4. Transcribed text displayed in `ContentView`.
- **State Management**:
   - Use of Swift Combine framework for reactive state binding.
